        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <h4><b>RIKENNECT</b> | 01/26</h4>
          <h5>In Production</h5>
          <p class="motto">A faceless media project using reality and statistical context to counter social 
          media illusion and reduce the pressure embedded in digital narratives.</p>
          <h4><b>25CC</b> | 01/26</h4>
          <h5>Live</h5>
          <p class="motto">Portfolio of early-stage projects in emerging and applied technologies. These 
          projects explore how to leverage modern technical capabilities while maintaining a strong focus 
          on real-world utility, intentional design, and reduced reliance on constant screen interaction.
          The work is ongoing and iterative, with an emphasis on experimentation, validation, and shipping.</p>
          <h4><b>ELBO</b> | 25</h4>
          <h5>Backlog</h5>
          <p class="motto">Elbo is designed to protect elderly users from fraud in an increasingly automated 
          world. Using AI as a supporting layer rather than a replacement, it helps restore clarity, confirmation, 
          and human control in digital interactions that are too often irreversible.</p>
          <h4><b>HUMANSIGNAL</b> | 26</h4>
          <h5>Backlog</h5>
          <p class="motto">A system for understanding when professional relationships actually matter. Instead 
          of encouraging constant outreach or performance-driven networking, it helps you recognize moments of 
          relevance, shared context, and natural alignment. So connection happens with intent, timing, and 
          respect, rather than pressure or habit.</p>
          <h4><b>KAYZN</b> | 23</h4>
          <h5>Backlog</h5>
          <p class="motto">Kayzn operates where research, culture, and scale intersect. Participation is driven 
          through contemporary channels, while AI is applied at the analysis stage to translate engagement at 
          scale into consumer insight grounded in real-world behavior.</p>
          <h4><b>KERNL</b> | 26</h4>
          <h5>Backlog</h5>
          <p class="motto">Kernl helps you stay aligned with what matters in your industry & personal interests without drowning in content. 
          By continuously tracking what creators and podcasts are actually talking about, it surfaces where attention 
          is being spent, where ideas are converging, and what’s worth your limited time. Knowledge compounds 
          instead of competing with your day.</p> 
          <h4><b>LIFEKEY</b> | 21</h4>
          <h5>Backlog</h5>
          <p class="motto">A blockchain-backed health data layer focused on continuity, ownership, and trust. It allows personal medical 
          information to be securely managed and shared without relying on disconnected institutional databases.</p>       
          <h4><b>/SENTIENT/</b> | 26</h4>
          <h5>Backlog</h5>
          <p class="motto">A single-page awareness system designed to make the state of your work visible. By 
          surfacing overload, imbalance, and hidden complexity early, it acts as a nervous and immune layer. 
          Helping you stay oriented, avoid slow failure, and make decisions from clarity rather than accumulation.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="motto">25 Collective Co is an independent body of work centered on building and testing early-stage projects in emerging 
          and applied technologies. The focus is on real-world utility, intentional design, and systems that reduce unnecessary 
          friction, abstraction, and dependence on constant screen interaction. The work is ongoing and iterative, shaped by 
          experimentation, validation, and shipping rather than fixed outcomes.
          <br><br>This approach is informed by years of experience working across diverse teams and global environments, including 
          periods of growth, transformation, and operational strain. Having worked closely with roles ranging from entry-level 
          contributors to executive leadership, the emphasis has consistently been on listening, adapting, and building tools 
          and processes that support sustainable execution. 25 Collective Co represents a continuation of that trajectory: a space 
          to explore how modern technical capabilities can be applied thoughtfully, with resilience, clarity, and long-term 
          value in mind.</p>
